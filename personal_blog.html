            <p>React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library 
                for building user interfaces or UI components. It is 
                maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers
                and companies.
                It is a JavaScript library created for building fast 
                and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications.
                React was 
                 created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook.
