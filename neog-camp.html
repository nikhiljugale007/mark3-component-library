        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Amazon opened its first brick and mortar retail store
        in Seattle, Washington, United States. The novelty of this store is that
        customers can just pick up whatever they want and just walk out of the
        store. Amazon would just charge the price of the items taken to their
        Amazon account. They call it the ‘Just Walk Out’ technology. Would it
        become a game-changer or disruptor in retail? Only time will tell.

      <h2>What is Just Walk Out Technology??</h2>
      <p>
        Customers must scan their QR code from amzon app along the path of
        entry.Once the customer is in the store, they can pick up any number of
        items they require and simply put it in their cart. When a customer
        picks a item, the item is added to his amazon app cart on mobile. With
        the required items in their bag, the customers can simply walk out of
        the store. The application would generate a receipt for the purchases
        and the total amount would be charged to the Amazon account associated
        with the application.
        <br />
        All this happens through the work of multiple cameras placed along the
        roof of the store. The cameras map tracks all the items that are picked
        and the person who picks them. Moreover, when an item is picked off the
        shelf, that item is instantaneously added to the virtual shopping cart
        of the customer. If the customer puts it back, the item is automatically
        removed. This points to technology which tracks the movement of goods
        from the shelf. Perhaps they are cameras or infra-scanners on the shelf
        itself. With this intricate mapping of cameras, Amazon Go also tracks
        the buying patterns of each customer.

        The first store, located in the company's Day 1 building, opened to
        employees on December 5, 2016, and to the public on January 22, 2018.<br />
        As of 2020, there are 27 open and announced store locations in Seattle,
        Chicago, San Francisco and New York City.
